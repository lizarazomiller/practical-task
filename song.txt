I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colorful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms

It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean (yours is the only ocean)
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna hang on
